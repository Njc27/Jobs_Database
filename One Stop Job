The objective of this project is to create a database for job finders where they need to type in the job role and select from which job sites 
they will apply for that job. The database will consist data from the most visited job sites like Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster etc., 
with columns Job Id, Job role, Job Description, Skills, Company, Location, Job site (link to the site). 

Using BeautifulSoup in python, we scrape the necessary data required and store them in a csv file. Later this csv file is cleaned from duplicate 
and null values. By then storing this data in a sql table we can perform the necessary operations such as : Searching and Filtering the data.
